# 2026-02-11 Daily Log (Continued)

## Session Highlights
- Successfully configured and enabled multiple LLM providers in `openclaw.json`: Kimi K2.5 (via two Nvidia providers), X AI (with API key), and Grok variants (grok-1 to grok-4-fast).
- Set default model to Kimi K2.5 (`moonshotai/kimi-k2.5`).
- Successfully configured WhatsApp connection (`wacli`) and sent test messages to both work and personal numbers, confirming connectivity (CONNECTED: true after manual re-auth).
- Added TG ID 6532028360 to Telegram allowlist and confirmed Gateway restart via tool call, finally applying configurations.
- Created the structure for the `hk-construction` skill, including reference files and a daily update script.

## Decisions
- Prioritized file-based persistence for configurations and memories.
- Decided to use Kimi K2.5 as the default model for general processing after environment issues prevented immediate testing of Grok.
- Cleared previous wacli sessions/store to resolve persistent 'CONNECTED: false' issues, followed by successful re-authentication via QR scan.

## Pending
- No immediate critical path items outstanding. Ready for next task or running the `hk-construction` skill's scheduled jobs.
